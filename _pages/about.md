<h3> about </h3>

I'm a senior at Harvard studying CS + Statistics and pursuing a concurrent masters in Computer Science. I am currently working at Scale AI as a Software Engineering Intern on [Spellbook](https://scale.com/spellbook).

At Harvard, I'm working on [LLM interpretability research](/projects/attention) at the [Harvard Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/). Previously, I've conducted research in computer vision intepretability (Torralba Lab @ MIT CSAIL), [deep learning for cancer drug discovery](/projects/deepexplain) (Liu Lab @ Harvard School of Public Health), and [machine learning for omics modeling](/projects/reversecnn) (Rubin Lab @ Stanford).

<!-- My research interests are in developing visualization techniques to understand patterns in large language models. , supervised by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda ViÃ©gas.  -->

I've led the startup sourcing team at Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners, served as a Peer Advising Fellow, directed the HCS Builders Incubation Program. I am also the founder of [Opportunity X](https://opportunityx.org/), a student-led nonprofit that has created research programs at 27 middle schools across the nation for over 2000 students.
