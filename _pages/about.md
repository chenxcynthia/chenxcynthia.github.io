I am a junior at Harvard University pursuing a concurrent Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science. I am originally from Cupertino, California.

Currently, I am an undergraduate researcher at the [Harvard Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/), supervised by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viegas. My research interests are in the field of AI intepretability, with a particular emphasis on visualizing attention in transformer models.

At Harvard, I've helped lead the Harvard Computer Society, Women in Computer Science, and Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners. I served as a Statistics 110 Teaching Fellow and a Peer Advising Fellow, and I am also on the Harvard Women's Club Volleyball team.
<!-- involved with the [Harvard AI Safety Team](https://haist.ai/). -->

Previously, I've worked at IMC, Hudson River Trading, LinkedIn, and Jemi (YC S20) and conducted machine learning research at MIT CSAIL, Harvard School of Public Health, and Stanford. I also founded [Opportunity X](https://opportunityx.org/), a student-led nonprofit that has created research programs at 27 middle schools for 2000+ low-income students. This summer, I'll be a software engineering intern at [Scale AI](http://scale.com/).

In my free time, I love trying new coffee shops, doing hot yoga, and creating [artistic data visualizations](https://github.com/cynthia9chen/data-art).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chenxcynthia), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cchen18/), and [Github](https://github.com/cynthia9chen), or shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:cynthiachen@college.harvard.edu">cynthiachen@college.harvard.edu</a>. I'd love to chat!
