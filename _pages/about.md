<h3> about </h3>

I'm a rising senior at Harvard studying Computer Science and Statistics and pursuing a concurrent master's in Computer Science.

I am currently working on [transformer interpretability research](/projects/attention) at the Harvard [Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/), supervised by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Vi√©gas. In the past, I've worked on research projects in computer vision intepretability (Torralba Lab @ MIT CSAIL), [deep learning for cancer drug discovery](/projects/deepexplain) (Liu Lab @ Harvard School of Public Health), and [computational biology](/projects/reversecnn) (Rubin Lab @ Stanford).

<!-- My research interests are in developing visualization techniques to understand patterns in large language models.  -->

In school, I help run [MITxHarvard Women in AI](https://mitharvardwai.github.io/index.html) and am a member of the Harvard Women's Club Volleyball team. I've directed the HCS Builders Incubation Program, led the startup sourcing team at Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners, and served as a Peer Advising Fellow. I am also the founder of [Opportunity X](https://opportunityx.org/), a student-led nonprofit that has created research programs for 2000+ low-income students at 27 middle schools across the nation.

I am originally from sunny Cupertino, California. In my free time, I enjoy exploring coffee shops, doing yoga, and tinkering with [artistic data visualizations](https://github.com/chenxcynthia/data-art).
