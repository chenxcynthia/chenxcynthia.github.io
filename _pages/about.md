<h3> about </h3>

I'm Cynthia, a senior at Harvard studying Computer Science and Statistics. I'm passionate about building AI + data software and doing research in AI interpretability.

Some things I've worked on:
- Building software at [Scale AI](scale.com), [Hudson River Trading](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/), and [LinkedIn](linkedin.com).
- AI interpretability research, from [visualizing transformer attention patterns](/projects/attention) to [decoding sequence patterns in deep neural networks](/projects/deepexplain).
- Tinkering with data as an [artistic medium](https://chenxcynthia.github.io/projects/).
- Founding [Opportunity X](https://opportunityx.org/), a student-led nonprofit that has created research programs at 27 under-resourced schools for 2000+ middle school students nationwide. 

At Harvard, I am a [Roberts Family Technology Innovation Fellow](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/roberts-family-fellows/Pages/default.aspx), help teach a course on artistic data visualization, and enjoy organizing events to build the Harvard startup community.
