<!-- <h3> about </h3> -->

I'm a Harvard CS student with interests in software, startups, and machine learning. I'm passionate about [building startup community](https://harvardstartups.vercel.app/) and thinking about how to design better interfaces.

Previously, I've built backend systems and software at [Scale AI](https://scale.com), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com), and [Jemi](https://jemi.so/). In August 2024, I'll be joining [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) as a software engineer.

I've also worked on AI interpretability research, specifically visualizing attention and information flow in transformers (check out our recent [paper]). I currently work with Professors Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viegas at Harvard's [Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu).

I am a [Roberts Family Technology Innovation Fellow](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/roberts-family-fellows/Pages/default.aspx), a Teaching Fellow for [CS 73: Code, Data, and Art](https://wattenberg.github.io/cs73/), and the founder of [Opportunity X](https://opportunityx.org/).

My [research](https://chenxcynthia.github.io/projects/attention/) is supervised by [Prof. Martin Wattenberg](https://www.bewitched.com/) at the [Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu). -->

<!-- I also enjoy developing research methods to understand AI models and exploring the intersection of art and data. -->

<!-- What I've worked on:
- Developing software at [Scale AI](scale.com), [Hudson River Trading](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/), and [LinkedIn](linkedin.com). 
- Investigating the inner workings of transformer language models. My [research]() is supervised by [Prof. Martin Wattenberg](https://www.bewitched.com/) at the [Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu). Check out our paper on [attention pattern visualization](!
- Creating [artistic data visualizations](https://chenxcynthia.github.io/projects/) by using data as an artistic medium.
- Founding [Opportunity X](https://opportunityx.org/), a student-led nonprofit that has created research programs at 27 under-resourced schools for 2000+ middle school students nationwide. 

At Harvard, I am a [Roberts Family Technology Innovation Fellow](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/roberts-family-fellows/Pages/default.aspx) and a Teaching Fellow for [CS 73](https://wattenberg.github.io/cs73/), a course on generative and data-driven artwork. I also enjoy playing volleyball on the women's club team and organizing events within the Harvard startup community.  -->
