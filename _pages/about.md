I am a junior at Harvard University pursuing a concurrent Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science. I am originally from Cupertino, California.

Currently, I am an undergraduate researcher at the Harvard Insight and Interaction Lab, supervised by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viegas. My research interests are in the field of AI intepretability, with a particular emphasis on visualizing attention in transformer models

At Harvard, I've led several student orgs, including the Harvard Computer Society, Harvard Women in Computer Science, Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners. I am also a member of the Women's Club Volleyball Team and a Peer Advising Fellow.
