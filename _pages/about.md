I'm a rising senior at Harvard University pursuing a concurrent Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science. I am originally from sunny Cupertino, California.

Currently, I am conducting machine learning research at the [Harvard Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/), supervised by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viegas. My research interests are in the field of AI intepretability, with a particular emphasis on visualizing attention in transformer models. In the past, I've worked on several research projects at MIT CSAIL, Harvard School of Public Health, and Stanford.

At Harvard, I am the co-president of [MITxHarvard Women in AI](https://mitharvardwai.github.io/index.html) and a member of the Women's Club Volleyball team. I've helped lead the Harvard Computer Society, Women in Computer Science, and Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners. I also served as a Statistics 110 Teaching Fellow and a Peer Advising Fellow.
<!-- involved with the [Harvard AI Safety Team](https://haist.ai/). -->

Previously, I've worked at IMC, Hudson River Trading, LinkedIn, and Jemi (YC S20).  This summer, I'll be a software engineering intern at [Scale AI](http://scale.com/). I am also the founder of [Opportunity X](https://opportunityx.org/), a student-led nonprofit that has created research programs for 2000+ low-income students at 27 middle schools across the nation.

In my free time, I love trying new coffee shops, doing hot yoga, and creating [artistic data visualizations](https://github.com/cynthia9chen/data-art).
