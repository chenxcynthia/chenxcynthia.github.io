<h4> About </h4>

I'm currently an engineer at [Decagon](https://decagon.ai/), building AI agents for enterprise customer support. I recently graduated from Harvard, where I studied Computer Science and Statistics, researched at the [Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/), and launched [Startups @ Harvard](https://www.startupsatharvard.com/). Previously, I worked at [Scale AI](https://scale.com), [HRT](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/), and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com).

<!-- I'm also working on AI interpretability research at Harvard's [Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu). I'm interested in visualizing transformer models (check out our recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03210.pdf) on transformer attention). -->

<!-- I am a [Neo Scholar](https://neo.com/), an HBS Roberts Family [Technology Innovation Fellow](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/roberts-family-fellows/Pages/default.aspx), and the founder of [Opportunity X](https://opportunityx.org/). -->

<h4> Let's chat </h4>
I'd love to hear from you via <a href="mailto:cynthia9chen@gmail.com">email</a>. I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chen-cynthia/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chenxcynthia).

<!-- I've also worked on AI interpretability research, specifically on visualizing transformer attention and  (check out our recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03210.pdf) on visualizing transformer attention). My [research](https://chenxcynthia.github.io/projects/attention/) is supervised by [Prof. Martin Wattenberg](https://www.bewitched.com/) at the [Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu). -->

<!-- I also enjoy developing research methods to understand AI models and exploring the intersection of art and data. -->

<!-- What I've worked on:
- Developing software at [Scale AI](scale.com), [Hudson River Trading](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/), and [LinkedIn](linkedin.com).
- Investigating the inner workings of transformer language models. My [research]() is supervised by [Prof. Martin Wattenberg](https://www.bewitched.com/) at the [Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu). Check out our paper on [attention pattern visualization](!
- Creating [artistic data visualizations](https://chenxcynthia.github.io/projects/) by using data as an artistic medium.
- Founding [Opportunity X](https://opportunityx.org/), a student-led nonprofit that has created research programs at 27 under-resourced schools for 2000+ middle school students nationwide.

At Harvard, I am a [Roberts Family Technology Innovation Fellow](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/roberts-family-fellows/Pages/default.aspx) and a Teaching Fellow for [CS 73](https://wattenberg.github.io/cs73/), a course on generative and data-driven artwork. I also enjoy playing volleyball on the women's club team and organizing events within the Harvard startup community.  -->
