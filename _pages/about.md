<h3> about </h3>

I'm a rising senior at Harvard studying Computer Science and Statistics and pursuing a concurrent master's in Computer Science.

Currently, I am exploring [transformer interpretability research](/projects/attention) at Harvard's [Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/), supervised by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Vi√©gas. In the past, I've worked on various research projects in [deep learning for cancer drug discovery](/projects/deepexplain) (Liu Lab @ Harvard School of Public Health), [computational biology](/projects/reversecnn) (Rubin Lab @ Stanford), and computer vision intepretability (Torralba Lab @ MIT CSAIL).

<!-- My research interests are in developing visualization techniques to understand patterns in large language models.  -->

I am involved with [MITxHarvard Women in AI](https://mitharvardwai.github.io/index.html) and the Harvard Women's Club Volleyball team. In the past, I directed the Harvard Computer Society's Builders Incubation Program, led the Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners sourcing team, and served as a Peer Advising Fellow. I am also the founder of [Opportunity X](https://opportunityx.org/), a student-led nonprofit that has created research programs for 2000+ low-income students at 27 middle schools across the nation.

<!-- At Harvard, I am the co-president of [MITxHarvard Women in AI](https://mitharvardwai.github.io/index.html) and a member of the Women's Club Volleyball team.

<!-- This summer, I'll be a software engineering intern at [Scale AI](http://scale.com/) on their Enterprise Generative Platform team. Previously, I've worked at IMC, Hudson River Trading, LinkedIn, and Jemi (YC S20).

I am originally from sunny Cupertino, California. In my free time, I enjoy exploring coffee shops, doing hot yoga, and tinkering with [artistic data visualizations](https://github.com/cynthia9chen/data-art).
