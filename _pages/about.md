<h4> About </h4>

I'm currently an engineer at [Decagon](https://decagon.ai/), building AI agents for customer support. I received my Bachelor's and Master's in Computer Science from Harvard, where I launched [Startups @ Harvard](https://www.startupsatharvard.com/), did research at the [Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/), and was named a [Technology Innovation Fellow](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/academic-experience/joint-degree-programs/undergraduate-technology-innovation-fellows-program/profiles). Prior to Decagon, I worked at [Scale AI](https://scale.com), [HRT](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/), and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com).


<h4> Let's chat </h4>
I'm based out of SF, where I run a startup discussion group on the weekends. I'd love to hear from you via <a href="mailto:cynthia9chen@gmail.com">email</a> or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chen-cynthia/).
