<h4> About </h4>

I'm a Harvard CS student passionate about building creative and impactful software. 

I'm currently working on [AI interpretability research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03210.pdf), <a href='#data'>creating visualizations with data and art</a>, and [building startup community at Harvard](https://harvardstartups.vercel.app/).

Previously, I've worked on backend systems and AI products at [Scale AI](https://scale.com), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com), and [Jemi](https://jemi.so/). I'll be joining [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) as a software engineer in August 2024.

<!-- I'm also working on AI interpretability research at Harvard's [Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu). I'm specifically interested in visualizing transformer models (check out our recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03210.pdf) on transformer attention). -->

I am a [Roberts Family Technology Innovation Fellow](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/roberts-family-fellows/Pages/default.aspx), a Teaching Fellow for CS 73 and Stat 110 at Harvard, and the founder [Opportunity X](https://opportunityx.org/).

My [research](https://chenxcynthia.github.io/projects/attention/) is supervised by [Prof. Martin Wattenberg](https://www.bewitched.com/) at the [Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu). -->

<!-- I also enjoy developing research methods to understand AI models and exploring the intersection of art and data. -->

<!-- What I've worked on:
- Developing software at [Scale AI](scale.com), [Hudson River Trading](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/), and [LinkedIn](linkedin.com). 
- Investigating the inner workings of transformer language models. My [research]() is supervised by [Prof. Martin Wattenberg](https://www.bewitched.com/) at the [Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu). Check out our paper on [attention pattern visualization](!
- Creating [artistic data visualizations](https://chenxcynthia.github.io/projects/) by using data as an artistic medium.
- Founding [Opportunity X](https://opportunityx.org/), a student-led nonprofit that has created research programs at 27 under-resourced schools for 2000+ middle school students nationwide. 

At Harvard, I am a [Roberts Family Technology Innovation Fellow](https://www.hbs.edu/mba/roberts-family-fellows/Pages/default.aspx) and a Teaching Fellow for [CS 73](https://wattenberg.github.io/cs73/), a course on generative and data-driven artwork. I also enjoy playing volleyball on the women's club team and organizing events within the Harvard startup community.  -->
