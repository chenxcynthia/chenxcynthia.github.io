I'm a rising senior at Harvard University studying Computer Science and Statistics and pursuing a concurrent master's in Computer Science.

Currently, I am working on [transformer interpretability research](/projects/induction) at Harvard's [Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/), supervised by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Vi√©gas. In the past, I've worked on various research projects including [decoding neural networks to identify cancer sequence motifs](/projects/deepexplain) (Liu Lab @ Harvard School of Public Health), [predicting blood glucose levels for pre-diabetic patients](/projects/reversecnn) (Rubin Lab @ Stanford), and visualizing activations in computer vision models (Torralba Lab @ MIT CSAIL).

<!-- My research interests are in developing visualization techniques to understand patterns in large language models.  -->

At Harvard, I've helped lead the Harvard Computer Society, [MITxHarvard Women in AI](https://mitharvardwai.github.io/index.html), Women in Computer Science, and Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners. I'm also a part of the Harvard Women's Club Volleyball team, and I've served as a Statistics 110 Teaching Fellow and a Peer Advising Fellow.

<!-- involved with the [Harvard AI Safety Team](https://haist.ai/). -->

This summer, I'll be a software engineering intern at [Scale AI](http://scale.com/) on their Enterprise Generative Platform team. Previously, I've worked at IMC, Hudson River Trading, LinkedIn, and Jemi (YC S20). I am also the founder of [Opportunity X](https://opportunityx.org/), a student-led nonprofit that has created research programs for 2000+ low-income students at 27 middle schools across the nation.

I am originally from sunny Cupertino, California. In my free time, I enjoy exploring random coffee shops,  doing hot yoga, and tinkering with [artistic data visualizations](https://github.com/cynthia9chen/data-art).
