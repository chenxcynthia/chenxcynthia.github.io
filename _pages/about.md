<h3> about </h3>

I'm a senior at Harvard studying CS and Statistics and pursuing a concurrent Masters in CS. This past summer, I was a software engineer on the Enterperise Generative AI Platform team at [Scale AI](scale.com).

Currently, I conduct [transformer interpretability research](/projects/attention) at the [Harvard Insight and Interaction Lab](https://insight.seas.harvard.edu/) supervised by Professor Martin Wattenberg (check out our [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03210.pdf) on visualizing the transformer attention mechanism). My research interests are largely at the intersection of AI interpretability and visualization. In the past, I've worked on understanding computer vision models at MIT CSAIL, decoding neural networks for [cancer drug discovery](/projects/deepexplain), and training ML models for predicting omics.

<!-- My research interests are in developing visualization techniques to understand patterns in large language models. , supervised by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda ViÃ©gas.  -->

At Harvard, I led the startup sourcing team at Harvard Undergraduate Capital Partners, directed the Harvard Computer Society's Builders Incubation Program, served as a Peer Advising Fellow for first-year students. In 2016, I founded [Opportunity X](https://opportunityx.org/), a student-led nonprofit that has created research programs at 27 under-resourced middle schools across the nation for over 2000 students.

<!-- I currently lead [MITxHarvard Women in AI](https://mitharvardwai.github.io/index.html) and play on the Harvard Women's Club Volleyball team. -->
