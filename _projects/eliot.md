### About 
[Eliot House](https://eliot.harvard.edu/), one of the twelve undergraduate residential houses at Harvard, is a special place for all who know it. From the friendly, familiar faces of the house staff to the bustling dining hall filled with students every evening, Eliot is a welcoming home on campus for hundreds of students. As an Eliot resident myself for the past three years, I’ve formed many meaningful relationships with others in the house and will always be grateful for Eliot's tight-knit community.

In this project, I wanted to portray the essence of the Eliot House community using data visualization. I gathered data from 38 Eliot students, asking them about people they lived with in Eliot and friends they met through Eliot. In the process of making the data visualization, I grappled with questions like: How can I capture the diversity of Eliot's community? What is the best way to visualize connections between people? How can I encode individuals' information while maintaining data privacy and anonymity?

As a whole, I hope to leave the viewer with a colorful impression of the Eliot community. At the end of the day, what makes Eliot special are its characters and connections, the people and community.

the diverse range of student backgrounds and interests, the coming together of people from different walks of life, and the incredible plethora of connections that Eliot has fostered.

### Process 
This was the first time I had collected my own data for a visualization piece. It was harder than I expected! Since it's very difficult to patch columns or attributes after collection, I had to think carefully

In the end, I decided to ask each student about their background (class year, hometown, concentration/secondary) and also to list the names of the people they'd lived with in Eliot and the people they had become friends with through Eliot.

Of course, not every person that was mentioned as a "connection" filled out the form, so

Every circle in this piece represents a single student, with the circle’s placement representing the student’s hometown and the circle’s colors encoding concentration and class year. Connections between students are drawn as curved arcs.
