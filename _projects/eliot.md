[Eliot House](https://eliot.harvard.edu/), one of Harvard's twelve residential houses for undergraduates, is a special place for all who know it. From the bustling dining hall filled with students, to the friendly, familiar faces of the house staff, Eliot is a welcoming home of unity among diversity. As a resident of Eliot for the past three years, I have made some of my closest and most cherished relationships on campus through the house, and I will always be grateful Eliot's for vibrant and tight-knit community.

As someone interested in using data visualization to draw out patterns at scale, I was curious to see whether I could visualize and portray the essence of the Eliot house community. In my piece, I sought to capture the diversity of student backgrounds, the coming together of people with different interests, and the plethora of connections that Eliot House has fostered.

Some questions I grappled with in this process were:

- How I capture the essence of the diversity and intellectual breadth of students in Eliot?
- What is the best way to show connections between students visually?
- How can I encode and represent individual information (e.g. hometown, concentration, class) in the visualization while maintaining data privacy and anonymity?
