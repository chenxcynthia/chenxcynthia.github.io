### About 
[Eliot House](https://eliot.harvard.edu/), one of Harvard's twelve residential houses for undergraduates, is a special place for all who know it. From the friendly, familiar faces of the house staff to the bustling dining hall filled with students every evening, Eliot is a welcoming home for over three hundred people. As an Eliot resident myself for the past three years, I’ve formed many close relationships with others in the house and will always be grateful for Eliot's tight-knit community.

I was interested in seeing whether I could portray the essence of the Eliot House community through a data visualization piece. In this work, I aimed to capture the colorful personality of Eliot’s community: the diverse range of student backgrounds and interests, the coming together of people from different walks of life, and the incredible plethora of connections that Eliot has fostered.

Some questions of the I grappled with in the process of making of this piece:
- How can I capture the breadth of intellectual diversity within the Eliot community?
- What is the best way to portray connections between individuals?
- How can I encode individual information (e.g. hometown, concentration, class) while maintaining data privacy and anonymity?
